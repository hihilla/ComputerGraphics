We seperatec tracks to segments (Mesila sections). On Mesila section we can calculate current position, tangent and normal at position. Mesila can be represented by spline and its length. We calculated constraints according to explenation in Tirgul and assignment. We broke track sections (Mesila) into smaller parts, and draw triangles in these sections according to splines that were calculated using the constraints.
